## Theme: Vitarana Drone

### About
In urban streets, especially South Asian streets, clogged with automobiles, people, animals, markets and numerous other things(!) using typical modes of transport for delivery, such as cars and bikes, is slow and wasteful. Fortunately, enabled by progress in embedded systems, materials science and control systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become widespread in the past couple of decades and provide a simpler and faster alternative to using terrestrial infrastructure!

These UAVs are a result of improvements in semiconductor and microprocessor technology, enabling faster chips and smaller, more efficient, power electronics. Improvements in materials sciences & manufacturing have led to the creation of novel, cheap, precise & robust sensors, along with huge improvements in battery technology. 

Vitarana Drone. Vitarana (IPA: vitaraá¹‡a) means distribution in Sanskrit and many extant languages of South Asia.
